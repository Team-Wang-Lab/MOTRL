Title: Multi-Objective Tree-based Reinforcement Learning for estimating optimal DTR
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yao Song
Maintainer: Yao Song <yaos@umich.edu>
Description: We propose a multi-Objective tree-based reinforcement learning 
    (MOTRL) method to directly estimate optimal DTRs in a multi-stage 
    multi-treatment setting. At each stage, T-RL builds an unsupervised decision 
    tree that directly handles the problem of optimization with multiple 
    treatment comparisons, through a purity measure constructed with augmented 
    inverse probability weighted estimators.
